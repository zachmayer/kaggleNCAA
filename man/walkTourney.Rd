}
\arguments{
\item{preds}{Predicted outcomes for ALL possible matchups}

\item{year}{The year of the tournament.  Used to subset preds, if preds
contain multiple seasons}

\description{
Given a parsed NCAA bracket, walk forward through each round
to generate a bracket
}
\details{
If your probabilities are transative, there's no reason to
simulate the tournament.  You can just walk forward to generate a bracket
}
\note{
Much faster than simulation
