#Kaggle NCAA Bracket Simulator
Simulate the NCAA tournament based on a kaggle-format bracket (with predictions for every possible matchup).  

## First, re-install the package:
```{r, echo = TRUE, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github('zachmayer/kaggleNCAA')
```

## Now load the tournment from a csv
This `seed_benchmark_men.csv` is a simple seed-based benchmark I made.  Turn it into a bracket with 4 functions: 

 - `parseBracket` to load the data from a .csv     
 - `simTourney` to simulate the tourney (you can also use `walkTourney`).  Use at least 1000 simulations (more is better).  One day I will parallelize this =D    
 - `extractBracket` to extract a bracket from the simulation results    
 - `printableBracket` to actually print the bracket   

(Load my data with ```{r} data(sample_submission_men, package='kaggleNCAA')``` if you want to just use the seeds)
```{r sim_bracket, echo = TRUE, fig.show='hold', dev='png', fig.width=11, fig.height=8.5, dpi=250}
set.seed(1)
library('kaggleNCAA')
dat <- parseBracket('seed_benchmark_men.csv')
sim <- simTourney(dat, 1000, progress=TRUE)
bracket <- extractBracket(sim)
printableBracket(bracket)
```
If simulation's not your thing (e.g. your predicted probabilities are transitive), you can also "walk" forward through the tournament, which is much faster:
```{r walk_bracket, echo = TRUE, fig.show='hold', dev='png', fig.width=11, fig.height=8.5, dpi=250}
bracket <- walkTourney(dat)
printableBracket(bracket)
```
Note in this case that the probabilities associated with the team making it to a given round will be incorrect
